# Plugin documentation

MegaBoids is a plugin designed to handle movement of ambient entity groups. Even though it sports the "boid" name, it goes way beyond the usual boids algorithm. It does however provide the three core elements of boids (alignment, cohesion and separation) as it's foundation yet it allows to strap on both environment forces as well as driving forces to give your boids consciousness. Let's go in more detail into these concepts.
